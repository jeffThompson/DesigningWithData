# PART 3: WORK IN PROGRESS

### TLDR  
* Due April 28  
* Continue working on your project this week  
* Turn in a draft (or screenshot) of your project on Canvas  

***

### WORK IN PROGRESS  
Next week, we'll have studio time for you to work on your projects, and get feedback and help. There are no specific deliverables, since your projects are all different, but you should make significant progress this week. (Especially since next week is our last meeting together before the critique!)

Think about what's required for a minimum version of your project. (In programming, we often create what's called a *minimum viable product* document, or MVP â€“ [more on that here](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming2/blob/master/Week07_Simulation/Part1-ResearchAndMVPDocument.md#create-an-mvp-document), if you're interested.) Prioritize the stuff that needs to happen for your project to be completed, even if those steps aren't the most fun. You can always add cool features later!

Come ready to work next week in class.

### TURNING EVERYTHING IN  
Please upload a draft of your project to Canvas. This can be a `PDF` or screenshot (preferred), or any other way to show your progress so far.
