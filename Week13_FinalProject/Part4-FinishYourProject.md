# PART 4: FINISH YOUR PROJECT

### TLDR  
* Due May 11  
  * We'll have our critique from 9–11am in the regular classroom (not what's listed online)  
* Finish your project for the final critique  
* Turn in documentation of your project to Canvas (see below for details)  

***

### FINISH YOUR PROJECT  
For the final exam period (listed above) please finish your project for our critique. Think about how you can very briefly explain your project to us and what specific feedback you might want from us.

**⚠️ If your project needs to be printed, please note the Fab Lab hours may vary during the exam period! Check the hours and give yourself plenty of lead-time. If you want to print off-campus, FedEx is probably your best option, but the quality will not be as good. ⚠️**

Please come to the critique caffinated, ready to share your work and give feedback!

### TURNING EVERYTHING IN  
Since everyone's projects vary in format, please use one of the following options to turn in your work on Canvas:  

* Print/screen: upload your project to Canvas (`PDF` is preferred)  
* Video/animation: submit a link to your piece on YouTube, Vimeo, etc (please make sure the video is public or I can view it)  
* Code-based projects: submit a link to your project  
* Other formats: chat with me about what's the best way to turn in your project!
