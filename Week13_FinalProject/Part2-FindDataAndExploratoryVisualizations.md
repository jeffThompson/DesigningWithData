# PART 2: FIND DATA, EXPLORATORY VISUALIZATIONS

### TLDR  
* Due April 22  
* Find data for your topic  
* Create 1–2 exploratory visualiations  
* Turn in to Canvas  
  * Screenshots/images of your visualization(s)  
  * 1–2 sentences describing what you found

### FIND DATA FOR YOUR TOPIC  
With a sense of your project's topic and approach, your main task this week is to find data to work with. Be sure to keep track of the data's source so you can cite it later.

A few tips:  
* On Google, if you include `filetype:csv` or `filetype:xlsx`, the search will only return files with those extensions! For example, if I wanted data about whale population, I would search for: `whale population filetype:csv`  
* Before creating any visualizations, try exploring the data in Sheets: sorting by different values, doing some averaging or other calculations, etc  

If necessary, you may also need to clean up the data, remove unwanted elements, etc. Be sure to keep a copy of the original though!

### EXPLORATORY VISUALIZATIONS  
With some data in hand, the next step is to create 1–2 quick visualizations from it. Don't worry about styling or making it look pretty: this is just about seeing the data so you know what's there, what's interesting, and what format for presentation might make the most sense.

When done, write up a 1–2 sentence summary of what you found in the data.

### TURNING EVERYTHING IN  
When done, please take a screenshot of your exploratory visualization(s) and upload to Canvas, along with the summary of your findings.

No need to turn in anything for your data sources.
