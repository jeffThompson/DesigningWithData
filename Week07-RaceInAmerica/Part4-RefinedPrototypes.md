# PART 4: REFINED PROTOTYPE  

### TLDR  
* Due April 7  
* Create a refined version of your book  
* Publish your data on Sheets  
* Create an account on the `p5.js` Web Editor  

***

### REFINED PROTOTYPE  
Having received some feedback on your initial prototype, this week you should work on refining your book. This might include:

* Making things more readable  
* Improving the flow as you lead us through the story you want to tell  
* Creating a front/back cover  
* Adding extra elements like illustrations, quotes, etc  

If you haven't already, your book should include:

* Title and byline  
* Link to your data (more on this below)  
* At least three visualizations  
* A list of sources (though this can be in your published data instead)  

***

### PUBLISH DATA ON SHEETS  
With your project nearly done, publish your data to Google Sheets like with the previous assignment. If you're working with data that's not in `csv` format (like `json`, for example) you can upload them to Google Drive instead.

Be sure to include a way to get to your data! This might include a text link, a shortened URL, or a QR code.

***

### CREATE AN ACCOUNT ON THE `P5.JS` WEB EDITOR  
We'll have another round of feedback next week, followed by some demos of `chart.js`, a Javascript-based tool for creating interactive visualizations online. This will be our mode for the next few weeks: learning about `chart.js`, feedback on your projects, and work time.

To make this as easy as possible, please go to the [`p5.js` Web Editor](https://www.p5js.org/editor) and create an account. That's it! We'll use this site to help us develop and share these in-class projects.

### TURNING EVERYTHING IN  
When done, please...

* Upload a link to your data on Canvas  
* No need to turn in your Illustrator file  
* Be sure you have an account on the `p5.js` Web Editor!
