# PART 3: PROTOTYPES  

### TLDR  
* Due March 31  
* Prototype your book  
  * Include at least one visualization  
  * Other parts can be rough or wireframed  
* Watch *The Design of Nothing* by Andy Kirk  
* Nothing to turn in this week, just bring your WIP to class for feedback  
  * We'll have a studio day, so please come with coffee and a snack, and be ready to work!

### PROTOTYPE YOUR BOOK  
This week, your goal should be a rough prototype of your book, including at least one visualization (your book needs three total). This doesn't need to be perfect yet: instead, think about the wireframes we made in class and how you can weave a story through your book. This idea of "storytelling" is key here and in much of data vis: you can't do everything in a single visualization! Instead, how do you lead us through the story you're trying to tell? What is important for us to see first: the whole dataset, an important part, a human detail, an arresting image?

Another useful way to frame this work is using *Seven Stages of Creating a Data Visualization* by Ben Fry (co-creator of the Processing language and head of [Fathom Information Design](https://fathom.info)):  

* **Acquire:** Formulate a question, find your sources and gather data  
* **Parse:** What's in the data? What ideas does the data suggest?  
* **Filter:** Determine which data-points/correlations are most interesting, remove "noise" from dataset  
* **Mine:** Extract data for your visualization, double-check results  
* **Represent:** Correlate data into meaningful forms, create initial representations of data in visual form  
* **Refine:** Evaluate the results of early representations, iteratively refine the representation and question  
* **Interact:** View the results, look for interesting stories, add value or meaning through additions/features

### WATCH *THE DESIGN OF NOTHING*  
Please also watch Andy Kirk's amazing talk [*The Design of Nothing: Null, Zero, Blank*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqzAuqNPYVM). It's just over 20 minutes long but is packed with amazing examples for how to think about and deal with missing data.
