# PART 5: FINISH PROJECT  

### TLDR  
* Due April 14  
* Finish your book  
* Print and bind one copy for class  

*This week, you'll also start your final project. Be sure to check out that assignment for details.*

***

### FINISH YOUR BOOK  
This week, use the feedback you got in class to finish your book. This is the time for little details: tuning font size, the placement of elements, getting the flow to work, but most importantly telling the story from your data.

Be sure you include:  
* A title and byline  
* Some way for us to access your data (QR code, shortened URL, etc)  
* At least three visualizations  

If you want any feedback this week, feel free to email me your project as a `PDF` and I'll take a look!

### PRINT AND BIND ONE COPY  
When finished, please print, bind, and trim one copy of your book. You can do this any time the Fab Lab is open: check outside for the open hours. If you don't already have money in your DuckBills account, you'll need to add some before you can print.

Craft is important here! Keep your book nice and clean, no bent corners. Trim carefully and try to make it look as perfect as you can.

### TURNING EVERYTHING IN  
Please upload the `PDF` of your project to Canvas and bring your book to class.
